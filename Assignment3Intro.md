## Introduction 

Poverty is one of the most important issues in human development: the state or condition in which a person or community lacks the financial resources and essentials for a minimum standard of living so that the basic human needs cannot be met is the foundation to development. Basic freedom to satisfy basic needs like food, water, and clothing are restricted in this case so that further development on account of expanding substantive freedom would not be achieved. Poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa is particularly related to the epidemics of disease including malaria, cholera, Aids, and high infant death rates, and a lowering of the overall living standards, which is partly due to the inept leadership of a number of governance institutions: the long-term running strategies suit the best interest of powerful elites, so that African American countries’ institutions are not an externally-provide factor of production like labor or capital but an internally generated result of the country’s policies. The long-lasting unsolved feature of the internally generated problem that involves rich interaction between a large number of adaptive agents that are co-evolving indicates the inherent and complex nature of poverty issue in Sub-Saharan Africa. 

## Problem Statement

Research illustrates the idea that conventional uni- or multidimensional poverty assessments represented by Demographic and Health Surveys methodology with the base of census data are still fundamental and essential due to the long-term utilization and improvement (Bersisa & Heshmati, 2021); innovative high-resolution satellite methods represented by Random Forest Approach have the useful features to generate better prediction accuracies and higher prediction flexibilities within the increasing amount of available census data for single or multiple countries within a region. Although the studies build comparison between conventional and innovative measures, and indicate the benefits as well as insufficiencies of both methods, none of them clarified the best respective proportion recommended to employ census-based and innovative methodologies under the respective circumstances of different regions. Therefore, the literature gap appeared in the research, leading to my research question on the methodological system to balance the application of conventional micro-census measures and innovative geospatial measures to increase accuracy and flexibility in poverty assessment not only in the Sub-Saharan African countries without census abundance, but also in other countries in different regions with census available.
