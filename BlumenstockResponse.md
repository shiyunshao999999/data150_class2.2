Perspective Questions for today: 

Joshua Blumenstock states that a humbler data science could transform international developement while also limiting the number of alleged silver bullets that have missed their mark in recent years. Describe the promises, pitfalls, and ways forward Blumenstock uses as the foundation for his thesis.

Additionally, consider the following statements from three of your classmates regarding this article. 

"Good intent is not enough in data science when dealing with the problems which determine people's experiences" Anna Raymond

"Transparency is the underlying issue to many of these problems, so an increase in this on both ends(data based issues & human based issues) could lead to better results." Nira Nair

"In liew of such drastic potential for promoting applications yet demoralizing hinderances, the balancing act can become difficult." Kayla Seggelike

How do you response to these ideas regarding "good intent", "transparency", and the difficult "balancing act" when considering the intersection of human development with data science?



Here are my responses about the questions: 


From my perspective, the humbler data science means to have more respect to people, to be more practical to real-world conditions, and also using data science as an assistant to improve people's living status instead of just a flawed dominance machine leading to the conclusions. 

First, having more respect to people means to let people know exactly about the fact that their personal information is collected to be a part of big data to further study. People have the rights to know about the scenarios that their private information would be used into. In addition, since data science is used in places all over the world, moral responsibility should be held all the time. This builds a similar situation to private business making profit in other countries：although the business is not inside its native country, it shouldn't be used to hurt the citizens of other countries as a side effect of earning profit; the use of data science is also the same. 

Second, being more pratical to real-world conditions means to be more accurate. The article mentioned four pitfalls that data science faces nowadays. Because of the fact that the power to derive value from the data is gathered in the hands of those with power and wealth, which is just a small number of people, bolstering those with power rather than those vulnerable and really need help is an anticipated effect. 
Also, one of the most important factors to become more accurate is to undertand both the social and cultural environment of the issue studied on. Patterns detected in one place may not be generalized to other places; 


The first statement may mean that despite the initial good willingness that the technology in data science may help people to have a better life；as the reading saided, data science could help the government distribute humanitarian aid to the population with the most need so as to reduce poverty and improve public-health especially focused on the interventions during epidemic season. However, there are some unanticipated effects
