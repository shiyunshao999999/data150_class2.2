## Contrasting Monetary and Multidimensional Poverty Measures in a Low-Income Sub-Saharan African Country

## Authors: Lukas Salecker, Anar K.Ahmadov, Levla Karimli


First, the article systematically compared the monetary and multidimensional poverty measures in Rwanda, in the context of low-income countries and Sub-Saharan Africa based on a theoretical and conceptual level, explaining the reasons that multidimensional poverty measures should at least supplement standard monetary measures. The article included the comparison cross-section and over-time and examined the overlaps and differences between the two measures. Second, the study that the article presented designed the research to construct and examine the multidimensional poverty index that allows capturing multiple country-specific dimensions of poverty, determining intra-dimensional and cross-dimensional poverty measures specific for Rwanda, so as to analyze the finding of the empirical studies to the theories. The studies investigated poverty rates based on different locations, communities, and individual factors. Third, employing the findings and arguments, the article extended implications for policymakers and future studies on poverty assessment. 

The most important conclusion is that in general, the monetary measure and the multidimensional measure differ significantly in estimating poverty trend and incidence; specifically, estimated monetary poverty rates appear to be lower than estimated multidimensional poverty rates. Multidimensional measures are at least as practical and comparable across countries, but more solid in terms of accurately accounting for the nature of poverty.

Exclusively employing monetary indicators for poverty measurement in the context of a low-income country like Rwanda has a serious risk of underestimating the multi-faceted poverty and its change over time. In Rwanda, using monetary measure alone would not have been sufficient to adequately capture the high incidence of multidimensional poverty; compared with multidimensional considerations, failing to recognize some significant progress from monetary measure would send inaccurate signals to policymakers, leading to the ineffectiveness of policy actions; and the emphasis on the temporary boost of incomes from exclusive reliance on monetary measures would prevent progress in other important factors beyond incomes. 

The weaknesses of the study could be concluded in three. First, although disparities between the two assessment measures found in Rwanda could be employed in the East African context, generalizations beyond this region should not be made unless the context is verified to be similar. Second, assigning equal poverty status to all household members could be problematic due to the fact that it failed to take potential intra-household inequalities into account. Third, replacing original MPI indicators in the health dimensions (child mortality and malnutrition) with Disability and Health Functioning would only be able to represent a rather uncommon form of deprivation instead of more common forms of health deprivation including malnutrition. Finally, examining poverty in the form of headcounts would not be enough to represent the depth, intensity, or distributional inequalities of poverty. 

Future researches related to the study include to improve methods to better represent intra-household differences in multidimensional poverty assessment, to expand the scope of multidimensional measures, and to refine more accurate and representative indicators corresponding to the limitations at present.

## A Distributional Analysis of Uni-and Multidimensional Poverty and Inequalities in Ethiopia

The research employed 2 rounds of Ethiopian Households’ Social economic Survey dataset both from rural and small towns in Ethiopia to analyze the unidimensional and multidimensional poverty assessment and inequalities based on different determinants in Ethiopia. For conventional unidimensional poverty assessment, the research used consumption expenditure to analyze the poverty status of households in Ethiopia. For multidimensional poverty assessment, the study constructs empirical analysis through 6 dimensions with 14 indicators. By using multiple correspondence analyses (MCA), the research computes the multidimensional index by estimating the determinants’ relative weights, so as to build an explanation on poverty distribution for various classes. 
Finally, within the employment of the logit model, the study examines the determinants through both unidimensional and multidimensional poverty assessment, to obtain a deeper understanding about the effects of each determinant from the two measures. 
 
The analysis of the data collected is comprehensive since it divides the explanation into descriptive statistics’ results of major variables, extent of poverty using FGT and Multidimensional Poverty Indices, and Determinants of Unidimensional and Multidimensional Poverty. Descriptive statistics presents that due to the variations among households about different parts of consumption expenditure through standard deviation, there would be a large probability of significant inequality, which has a strong relationship between gender and the headship of the household: distribution of consumption expenditure varied enormously over time, region, and gender. Empirical results through FGT could further strengthen the conclusion about inequality. The distributional patterns of cumulative poverty gap curves, FGT curves, consumption dominance curves, and Lorenz curve which presents the degree of income inequality all reveal the incredible degree of inequalities of different groups in Ethiopia over time and by the area of residence. Other than unidimensional poverty assessment, multidimensional index of poverty, which is estimated by 6 dimensions with 14 indicators, considers the non-income dimensions of households’ well-being: the non-income indicators present high levels of deprivation in indicators including health, education, housing, asset, ownership, facility and energy use which are important for multidimensional assessment.
 
The study constructed in the article considers both unidimensional measure and multidimensional measure to take the strengths and weaknesses of both types of assessment into account. From the study, unlike the unidimensional measure, the multidimensional measure of poverty presents all the ways that poverty may manifest and illustrates the extent of deprivation as well. The results of the study show that a unidimensional approach understates the extent of poverty due to the fact that this method neglects non-monetary aspects. The study indicates that the extent of poverty based on multidimensional poverty assessment is so high that it requires corresponding policy interventions to reduce the rate; meanwhile inequalities among the multidimensional poverty were also considerably high both over time and across regions. For further implications, policymakers should consider various factors including regional variations, community realities, and households’ characteristics to reduce poverty.
