First, the article systematically compared the monetary and multidimensional poverty measures in Rwanda, in the context of low-income countries and Sub-Saharan Africa based on a theoretical and conceptual level, explaining the reasons that multidimensional poverty measures should at least supplement standard monetary measures. The article included the comparison cross-section and over-time and examined the overlaps and differences between the two measures. Second, the study that the article presented designed the research to construct and examine the multidimensional poverty index that allows capturing multiple country-specific dimensions of poverty, determining intra-dimensional and cross-dimensional poverty measures specific for Rwanda, so as to analyze the finding of the empirical studies to the theories. The studies investigated poverty rates based on different locations, communities, and individual factors. Third, employing the findings and arguments, the article extended implications for policymakers and future studies on poverty assessment. 

The most important conclusion is that in general, the monetary measure and the multidimensional measure differ significantly in estimating poverty trend and incidence; specifically, estimated monetary poverty rates appear to be lower than estimated multidimensional poverty rates. Multidimensional measures are at least as practical and comparable across countries, but more solid in terms of accurately accounting for the nature of poverty.
 
Exclusively employing monetary indicators for poverty measurement in the context of a low-income country like Rwanda has a serious risk of underestimating the multi-faceted poverty and its change over time. In Rwanda, using monetary measure alone would not have been sufficient to adequately capture the high incidence of multidimensional poverty; compared with multidimensional considerations, failing to recognize some significant progress from monetary measure would send inaccurate signals to policymakers, leading to the ineffectiveness of policy actions; and the emphasis on the temporary boost of incomes from exclusive reliance on monetary measures would prevent progress in other important factors beyond incomes. 
 
The weaknesses of the study could be concluded in three. First, although disparities between the two assessment measures found in Rwanda could be employed in the East African context, generalizations beyond this region should not be made unless the context is verified to be similar. Second, assigning equal poverty status to all household members could be problematic due to the fact that it failed to take potential intra-household inequalities into account. Third, replacing original MPI indicators in the health dimensions (child mortality and malnutrition) with Disability and Health Functioning would only be able to represent a rather uncommon form of deprivation instead of more common forms of health deprivation including malnutrition. Finally, examining poverty in the form of headcounts would not be enough to represent the depth, intensity, or distributional inequalities of poverty. 
 
According to the limitations and focus of the study, I think future researches related to the study could work on the method improvements to better represent intra-household differences in multidimensional poverty assessment, to expand the scope of multidimensional measures, and to refine more accurate and representative indicators corresponding to the limitations at present.

The research employed two rounds of Ethiopian Households’ Social economic Survey dataset both from rural and small towns in Ethiopia to analyze the unidimensional and multidimensional poverty assessment and inequalities based on different determinants in Ethiopia. For conventional unidimensional poverty assessment, the research used consumption expenditure to analyze the poverty status of households in Ethiopia. For multidimensional poverty assessment, the study constructs empirical analysis through 6 dimensions with 14 indicators. By using multiple correspondence analyses (MCA), the research computes the multidimensional index by estimating the determinants’ relative weights, so as to build an explanation on poverty distribution for various classes. 
Finally, within the employment of the logit model, the study examines the determinants through both unidimensional and multidimensional poverty assessment, to obtain a deeper understanding about the effects of each determinant from the two measures. 
 
The analysis of the data collected is comprehensive since it divides the explanation into descriptive statistics’ results of major variables, extent of poverty using FGT and Multidimensional Poverty Indices, and Determinants of Unidimensional and Multidimensional Poverty. Descriptive statistics presents that due to the variations among households about different parts of consumption expenditure through standard deviation, there would be a large probability of significant inequality, which has a strong relationship between gender and the headship of the household: distribution of consumption expenditure varied enormously over time, region, and gender. Empirical results through FGT could further strengthen the conclusion about inequality. The distributional patterns of cumulative poverty gap curves, FGT curves, consumption dominance curves, and Lorenz curve which presents the degree of income inequality all reveal the incredible degree of inequalities of different groups in Ethiopia over time and by the area of residence. Other than unidimensional poverty assessment, multidimensional index of poverty, which is estimated by 6 dimensions with 14 indicators, considers the non-income dimensions of households’ well-being: the non-income indicators present high levels of deprivation in indicators including health, education, housing, asset, ownership, facility and energy use which are important for multidimensional assessment.
 
The study constructed in the article considers both unidimensional measure and multidimensional measure to take the strengths and weaknesses of both types of assessment into account. From the study, unlike the unidimensional measure, the multidimensional measure of poverty presents all the ways that poverty may manifest and illustrates the extent of deprivation as well. The results of the study show that a unidimensional approach understates the extent of poverty due to the fact that this method neglects non-monetary aspects. The study indicates that the extent of poverty based on multidimensional poverty assessment is so high that it requires corresponding policy interventions to reduce the rate; meanwhile inequalities among the multidimensional poverty were also considerably high both over time and across regions. 

From my perspective, the relationship between social inequalities and poverty level from different perspectives including various indicators and different types of poverty assessment should be further studied. Since policies are essential to liberate people from poverty, and the study indicated that the considerations based on combinations of both unidimensional poverty assessment and multidimensional assessment are important, for further implications, policymakers should consider various factors including income differences, regional variations, community realities, and households’ characteristics to reduce poverty.

While the primary number of studies done on poverty determinants rely on the income, expenditure and consumption data, the data used in this study comes from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), which covered both rural and urban populations, and collected information relating to demographic and detailed information on asset ownership, access to public services and housing characteristics. The study in the article constructed an asset index, which presented the social economic status of each household, through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on the asset ownership variables in the 2003 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey and employed logistic regression with the SES (poor and non-poor) as the dependent variable to identify key determinants of poverty in Kenya. 
 
The KDHS included information regarding the ownership of durable goods, housing characteristics, access to services along with basic demographic information concerning household size and composition. The only variable that is included in the PCA as a continuous variable is the number of household members sharing a room for sleeping purposes. By utilizing the multivariate statistical technique PCA, the study was able to reduce the number of variables without losing too much information in the process by creating a fewer number of variables that explain most of the variation in the original variables at the same time
 
The study then determined whether the predictors age of household, size of household, educational level of the household head, type of residence (rural or urban), ethnicity and religion were associated with the poverty index SES through the employment of logistic regression model by estimating the probability that the household was poor. From the result that the model presented, variables were automatically added or dropped from the model. 
 
The results indicate that there is association between SES and the following predictor variables: Ethnicity; Religion; Number of household members; highest education level; Age of household head and Type of place of residence. Logistic Regression Analysis shows that there are higher levels of poverty in communities further from the national capital, Nairobi. Worst cases of household poverty relative to Nairobi are found to North Eastern province; households headed by a Protestants or other Christians and Muslims are comparably had higher prevalence of poverty than those headed by Catholic; rural households were more likely to poor as compared to Urban households; and nomadic communities were poorer than other communities in the country.
 
The limitations of the study on asset-based measures of poverty could be concluded in three: first, since the asset-based measures are more representative on the performance of long-run household instead of short-run, the asset index would not be the best for predicting outcomes associated with current resources; second, the ownership of household may not reflect the quality of the asset in every case; third, some of the variables may have a different relationship with the asset index across sub-groups.

Therefore, due to the limitations, I think that future studies on asset-based poverty assessment should focus on ways to eliminate the impact from its weaknesses, perhaps with the combination of other types of poverty assessment to reduce inaccuracy from only one measure despite the fact that the employment of asset index has plenty of advantages that other measures are lack of. Meanwhile, when politicians try to make policies based on asset-based measures of poverty, they should take both the strengths and defects into considerationin order to suit the specific conditions as much as possible.

Helsinki: World Institute for Development Economics Research- United Nations University. https://doi.org/10.35188/UNU-WIDER/2014/854-4


The article showed an alternative way of measuring poverty: the subjective assessments from respondents’ personal evaluation of the economic well-being of their household. Subjective poverty studies have been largely absent in the research on poverty evaluation of the South African area since the national household surveys that are used to measure money-metric poverty have not collected information on subjective economic well-being in most cases. 
 
Subjective evaluations of poverty do not require that respondents provide information on their income or expenditure, or have analysts define a poverty line. Instead the subjective assessments are likely to reflect the many dimensions of the household’s living standards especially in developing country contexts since income from small-scale activities is usually more difficult to measure, which may not be captured by current money-metric measurement based on income or expenditure. In the context of South Africa, state-subsidized housing and access to basic services such as electricity and water will not be reflected in income or expenditure measures of poverty, but will be reflected in subjective assessments of economic well-being. 
 
The study used the 2008 Living Conditions Survey data (LCS) to compare subjective poverty assessments with objective poverty assessments like money-metric measurement, and to analyze the situations when the two measurements failed to overlap. LCS not only asked the respondents to report their income and expenditure, but also asked their personal opinion about how they would assess the economic status of their household with the ranging from “very poor” to “wealthy.” Within the comparison between subjective and objective poverty rates across various key characteristics, the article estimates the predictors of subjective poverty assessment among households with the same level of per capita expenditure/income. 
 
The conclusion of the study includes both overlaps and mismatches between the results of money-metric and subjective measures of poverty in South Africa. There is considerable overlap between money-metric and subjective measures of poverty in South Africa: three-fifths of all households which are identified as poor in terms of per capita household expenditure are also self-assessed as poor. However, no matter how subjective poverty is measured, studies which compare money-metric and subjective poverty assessment would always find only a partial correlation between the two measures. The study identified a number of significant characteristics that distinguish households with poverty measures that do not overlap, and concluded that it’s partially because subjective assessments are influenced by various factors other than the household’s current economic resources which is the only factor considered in money-metric assessment, including the capability of the household to generate resources in the past and in the future, the household’s access to basic services, and the average health status of household members. The differences are consistent with the underestimation of economic resources in the measure of money-metric poverty, which occurs partly due to the fact that relatively lower consumption needs of children and people living in larger households are not recognized in per capita measures, and partly because the value of economic activity can be difficult to measure simply by data.

However, I think that it is insufficient that the study only considers one type of “objective” poverty assessment, money-metric assessment, and compares it with subjective measures based on subjects’ direct responses. Within my research, measures that are qualified to be “objective” measures are more than only this type: measures like multidimensional poverty assessment and asset-based poverty assessment are also based on empirical studies from large amounts of sample data to build inferences to population. Taking them into considerations to compare with subjective measures is important since one of the most distinct results of this study with the comparison between monetary measures which only based on income variations and subjective measures is the variety of factors taken into account; “objective” measures mentioned above are also influenced by various factors, which have the similar characteristics of the subjective assessment. Therefore, future studies about the comparisons and contrasts among these should be made to offer further analysis and conclusions regarding different types of poverty assessments.
