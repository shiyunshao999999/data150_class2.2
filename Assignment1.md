## Contrasting Monetary and Multidimensional Poverty Measures in a Low-Income Sub-Saharan African Country

## Authors: Lukas Salecker, Anar K.Ahmadov, Levla Karimli


First, the article systematically compared the monetary and multidimensional poverty measures in Rwanda, in the context of low-income countries and Sub-Saharan Africa based on a theoretical and conceptual level, explaining the reasons that multidimensional poverty measures should at least supplement standard monetary measures. The article included the comparison cross-section and over-time and examined the overlaps and differences between the two measures. Second, the study that the article presented designed the research to construct and examine the multidimensional poverty index that allows capturing multiple country-specific dimensions of poverty, determining intra-dimensional and cross-dimensional poverty measures specific for Rwanda, so as to analyze the finding of the empirical studies to the theories. The studies investigated poverty rates based on different locations, communities, and individual factors. Third, employing the findings and arguments, the article extended implications for policymakers and future studies on poverty assessment. 

The most important conclusion is that in general, the monetary measure and the multidimensional measure differ significantly in estimating poverty trend and incidence; specifically, estimated monetary poverty rates appear to be lower than estimated multidimensional poverty rates. Multidimensional measures are at least as practical and comparable across countries, but more solid in terms of accurately accounting for the nature of poverty.

Exclusively employing monetary indicators for poverty measurement in the context of a low-income country like Rwanda has a serious risk of underestimating the multi-faceted poverty and its change over time. In Rwanda, using monetary measure alone would not have been sufficient to adequately capture the high incidence of multidimensional poverty; compared with multidimensional considerations, failing to recognize some significant progress from monetary measure would send inaccurate signals to policymakers, leading to the ineffectiveness of policy actions; and the emphasis on the temporary boost of incomes from exclusive reliance on monetary measures would prevent progress in other important factors beyond incomes. 

The weaknesses of the study could be concluded in three. First, although disparities between the two assessment measures found in Rwanda could be employed in the East African context, generalizations beyond this region should not be made unless the context is verified to be similar. Second, assigning equal poverty status to all household members could be problematic due to the fact that it failed to take potential intra-household inequalities into account. Third, replacing original MPI indicators in the health dimensions (child mortality and malnutrition) with Disability and Health Functioning would only be able to represent a rather uncommon form of deprivation instead of more common forms of health deprivation including malnutrition. Finally, examining poverty in the form of headcounts would not be enough to represent the depth, intensity, or distributional inequalities of poverty. 

Future researches related to the study include to improve methods to better represent intra-household differences in multidimensional poverty assessment, to expand the scope of multidimensional measures, and to refine more accurate and representative indicators corresponding to the limitations at present.
