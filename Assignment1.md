A brief overview of various poverty assessment methods: quantitative analysis, qualitative analysis, spatial analysis, and mixed methods


  Quantitative Analysis: establish criteria prior to analysis
      can be either uni-dimensional (e.g. establishment of poverty line and head counts), 
      or multidimensional (e.g. Unsatisfied Basic Needs Index, Human Development Index)
      
   often based on large scale data collection efforts, and produce consistent data that allow for comparison across countries
   are important for targeting and allocation of resources, 
   although can be weak on the explanation of causality
  
  
  Qualitative Assessments: usually establish criteria during analysis and employ a multidimensional approach to poverty
      emphasize participation and local perceptions, and focus on causality
      but tend to be weaker on the enumeration of poor people
      
   based on selected representative samples, are often site specific and more difficult to compare across cases
   
   
  Spatial assessments: based on quantitative data and are important for targeting purposes
      constitute a powerful tool for presenting data and for comparing different aspects of poverty
 

The choice of a particular type of assessment methodology should be governed by the intended use of the information:
      factors include: 
      (i) the concept and definition of poverty (e.g. normative/empirical, factual/potential, absolute/relative) 
      (ii) the scale of analysis (household, community, district, etc.)
      (iii) budgetary constraints
      (iv) the academic background of those involved; and (v) donor-driven preferences.
