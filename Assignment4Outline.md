## Research Proposal: Balance Conventional Census-Based Measures and Innovative High-Resolution Satellite-Based Measures in Poverty Assessment Using Random Forest Approach: A Case Study in Kenya

 
## 1.	Introduction
 
### 1.1 Literature Gap
 
### 1.2 Research Question

### 1.3 Research Plan
 


## 2.  Hypothesis
 
### 2.1  Hypothesis on Accuracy Evaluation of the Proposed RF Model
 
H0: the adjusted R^2 value between the actual and estimated WI in Kenya < 0.50
 
HA: the adjusted R^2 value between the actual and estimated WI in Kenya >= 0.50
 
 
### 2.2  Accuracy Evaluation Compared with District-Level Census Data
 
H0: the r value between the estimated WI at grid-level and the estimated WI at the district-level ∈ [-1,0]
 
HA: the r value between the estimated WI at grid-level and the estimated WI at the district-level ∈ [0,1]
 
 
### 2.3  Replicability of the Model in Different Geographical Context
 
#### 2.3.1   	Replicability of the Model in Other Countries in Sub-Saharan Africa
 
H0: the adjusted R^2 value between the actual and estimated WI with the change of variable inputs in Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, and Rwanda < 0.50
 
HA: the adjusted R^2 value between the actual and estimated WI with the change of variable inputs in Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda, and Rwanda >= 0.50
 
 
#### 2.3.2   	Replicability of the Model in Countries other than Sub-Saharan Africa
 
H0: the adjusted R^2 value between the actual and estimated WI with the change of variable inputs in Bangladesh, Nepal, and the Mekong River Delta region in Vietnam < 0.50
 
HA: the adjusted R^2 value between the actual and estimated WI with the change of variable inputs in Bangladesh, Nepal, and the Mekong River Delta region in Vietnam >= 0.50
 
 
#### 2.4 Systematic tracking after government regulations on the change of variable inputs
 
H0: the estimated WI after government regulations - the estimated WI before government regulations = 0
 
HA: the estimated WI after government regulations - the estimated WI before government regulations ≠ 0
