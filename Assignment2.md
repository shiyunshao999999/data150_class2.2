## Introduction
 
Poverty is one of the most important issues in human development: the state or condition in which a person or community lacks the financial resources and essentials for a minimum standard of living so that the basic human needs cannot be met is the foundation to development. Basic freedom to satisfy basic needs like food, water, and clothing are restricted in this case so that further development on account of expanding substantive freedom would not be achieved. Different poverty assessments based on different focuses, variables, and indicators would employ diverse types of models to estimate poverty, leading to various policy actions and results to social development. Thus, within the comparative analysis between poverty assessments, limitations and advantages of the measurements are revealed so that scientists could build further improvements and applications in future research. 
 
The reason to select the region to be Sub-Saharan Africa is actually from Hans Rosling’s presentation: when he pointed out the Sub-Saharan African region alone in the plot of child-survival rates and GDP per capita, the plot revealed huge differences between countries in Africa, showing huge variation in economic and social development in this particular area. Therefore, I became interested in poverty assessment and analysis particular in Sub-Saharan Africa and understood that differences in cultural, political, and social characteristics between region to region are so important in Sub-Saharan Africa that should be considered inside analysis. 



## Conventional poverty measurements based on census surveys 
 
Conventional poverty measurements in the research include unidimensional and multidimensional assessment. Unidimensional money-metric measure considers only the income or expenditure insufficiency into the assessment of poverty. Although broaden aspects of development and attainment of human rights are included to define poverty in recent years, in most cases poverty reduction approaches are still based on income poverty conception by unidimensional poverty assessment, measured in terms of the number of people subsisting on less than the poverty line with n dollar per day. However, the economic system is a complex adaptive system that a single indicator could never be sufficient to explain the whole development process deeply and comprehensively. 
 
The monetary measure and the multidimensional measure differ significantly in estimating poverty trend and incidence; specifically, estimated monetary poverty rates appear to be lower than estimated multidimensional poverty rates. Multidimensional measures are at least as practical and comparable across countries, but more solid in terms of accurately accounting for the nature of poverty.
 
Thomas et al. employed two huge datasets, the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and the 2003 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS), which covered both rural and urban populations and collected information relating to demographic and detailed information on multiple indicators including asset ownership, access to public services and housing characteristics in the study. For conventional unidimensional poverty assessment, the research used consumption expenditure to analyze the poverty status of households in Ethiopia. For multidimensional poverty assessment, the study constructs empirical analysis through 6 dimensions with 14 indicators. By using multiple correspondence analyses (MCA), the research computes the multidimensional index by estimating the determinants’ relative weights, so as to build an explanation on poverty distribution for various classes. Within the employment of the logit model, the study identifies and examines key determinants with the SES (poor and non-poor) as the dependent variable through both unidimensional and multidimensional poverty assessment, to obtain a deeper understanding about the effects of each determinant from the two measures. The combination of both unidimensional and multidimensional assessment helped better understand the interaction among the various domains of poverty so as to make the analysis comprehensive. 
 
An alternative way of measuring poverty, the subjective assessments from the 2008 Living Conditions Survey data (LCS), which not only asked the respondents to report their income and expenditure, but also their personal evaluation of the economic well-being of their household is analyzed in the article Measure as poor versus feeling poor: Comparing money-metric and subjective poverty rates in South Africa. Subjective poverty studies have been largely absent in the research on poverty evaluation of the South African area since the national household surveys that are used to measure money-metric poverty have not collected information on subjective economic well-being in most cases. However, this assessment could also be concluded as a type of multidimensional assessment since the result from the data is used to reflect and analyze multiple indicators other than the income factor like access to education, health, electricity, water, sanitation, and physical and environmental security that are critical for wellbeing in different dimensions. 
 
Based on the research analysis, exclusively using unidimensional measurement, which in most cases means to employ only monetary indicators for poverty assessment, in the context of a low-income country has a serious risk of underestimating the multi-faceted poverty and its change over time. Although multidimensional measurement seems to be more comprehensive and suitable, the choices of indicators and dimensions that different researches made in analyzing specific aspects and focus would build comparison between different assessments. From my perspective, considering the monetary indicator alone in the unidimensional measurement would be the narrower view to assess poverty, and combining different measurements reasonably and comprehensively based on local context would be the expansive view to measure poverty. This idea corresponded to Amartya Sen’s understanding towards development: The narrower view of development would be the simple consideration on the growth of GNP, industrialization, technological advance, or individual income; the expansive perspective of development would be expanding substantive freedom that requires the removal of major sources of unfreedom like poverty, tyranny, poor economic opportunities is an expansive perspective.
 
 
 
## Innovative poverty measurements due to data-deprivation
 
In the article Estimation of Poverty in Somalia Using Innovative Methodologies, the challenges to assess poverty due to the absence of census surveys were overcome in wave two of the Somalia High Frequency Survey (SHFS) through methodological and technological adaptations within the employment of geospatial techniques and high-resolution imagery. The innovative methodology relies on satellite imagery and grid cells to model the spatial population distribution, build a probability‐based population sampling frame, and generate enumeration areas to estimate poverty in areas that remained completely inaccessible as a result mainly of insecurity. Early applications based on a diverse set of such satellite data sources use night‐time lights data to predict economic activity, which succeeded in predicting GDP at the country‐level but appear to be less suitable for measuring income when variation in welfare is desired at a highly disaggregated level. Deeper learning techniques in later research applied to daytime imagery are better at classifying objects from roof types, roads, tree coverage, and crops, leading to advances in measuring welfare at a more disaggregated level. Yeh et al. trained deep learning models to predict survey-based estimates of asset wealth across about 20,000 African villages from publicly-available multispectral satellite imagery. Jean et al. (2016) used a convolutional neural network based on daytime satellite features to predict per capita consumption from living standards measurement surveys. Their model is successful in predicting consumption and the result of variation across the nation. Engstrom et al. (2017) provide a recent overview of the state of the literature and use high‐resolution satellite features to estimate poverty at the village‐level. In the SHFS, estimating poverty in inaccessible areas relied on a linear model with the objective of creating reliable and transparent poverty measures. Minimizing the time spent in the field with the use of the Rapid Consumption Methodology, the innovative geospatial techniques and high-resolution satellite imagery methodologies could not only create poverty prediction models to overcome the stigma caused by data-deprivation, but could also employ a special sampling strategy for the nomadic population corresponding to distinctive local context in Sub-Saharan African region.




## Compare the similarities and differences between the two methodologies
 
First, in a data-deprived region, conventional unidimensional or multidimensional measurements of economic well-being cannot be employed due to the lack of abundant census survey data to be employed, while innovative geospatial techniques based on high-resolution satellite imagery have no inhibition to be used in assessment. Conventional poverty assessments are fundamental inputs into both research and policy, but such measures are unavailable at a local level in most of the Sub-Saharan Africa region. However, satellite-based geospatial methodologies used to measure poverty are both accurate and scalable, and consistent performance on held-out countries suggests that it could be used to generate wealth estimates in countries where data are unavailable. Models built from high-resolution satellite imagery can explain 70% of the variation in ground-measured village wealth in countries; compared with conventional poverty measurements from censuses, errors in satellite estimates are comparable to errors in existing ground data. Satellite-based estimates can also explain up to 50% of the variation in district-aggregated changes in wealth over time. The poverty estimation on satellite-based methodologies and the scalability by creating a wealth map in the Sub-Saharan area to a comprehensive level indicate the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the measurement, indicating their help for research and policy. 
 
Second, conventional census-based assessments could only estimate poverty situations at the national level but not at the sub-national level. Since census data are only georeferenced at second administrative levels, both the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and the 2003 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) are aggregated to the second-level administrative boundaries provided in the census data. Census data is aggregated using census household weights to construct representative district averages. A raw average across households is used to construct the corresponding DHS value; DHS data does not provide household weights that allow construction of sub-nationally representative estimates. Meanwhile, the various distribution of natural resources and wealth oil reveals the problem to simply use census-based measurements. Distribution of natural resources and wealth oil is the main resource base of Sub-Saharan African areas like Nigeria, Somalia, and Kenya, which composes the major proportion of money. However, the distribution is uneven in the region: most of the oil is produced in the south, but most of the money is controlled by the north. This is one of the main reasons that the economic well-being of the Sub-Saharan region has huge variation. Satellite-based measurements could represent data in local context by proposing a localization framework on a geo-referenced satellite map given a query ground view image within a small error. 
 
Third, the inconsistency to collect census data causes the outdatedness of census data, so that conventional poverty assessments based on the data would be inaccurate and ineffective. Due to the large cost and human resources dedicated to generating census surveys, census data sources are not regularly updated (mostly remain for ten years) especially in low-income countries like those in the Sub-Saharan African region. By contrast, innovative poverty assessments collect constantly updated data through mediums like satellites, so that the accuracy of the data provided in the innovative methodologies is secured. 



## Reflections on the gaps in the research
 
In the field of innovative geospatial techniques and high-resolution satellite imagery methodologies, further improvements on higher quality of the data should be considered to minimize disruptions and biases from human resource capacity. Future applications should consider refining the model to predict poverty from satellite imagery to improve the estimates by incorporating predictors with higher spatial frequencies. Moreover, despite the source Contrasting Monetary and Multidimensional Poverty Measures in a Low-Income Sub-Saharan African Country which suggested actions to improve the poverty situation based on the comparison of two assessments, other research put the focus purely on data collection, variable selection, indicator and dimension, and model without the explanation about future improvement on practical change. Therefore, further implication on policy makers should be analyzed and illustrated based on different poverty assessments; more combinations between the conventional and innovative measurements could also help the analysis become more localized and comprehensive. If there needs to be a central research question investigated into human development, I would ask about the policy actions from the local governments in Sub-Saharan Africa due to the focus and result of different types of assessments.
 
 
## Conclusion
 
There is no consensus on the best measure. However, a suitable measure should satisfy specific local context and conditions. Firstly, I illustrated the conventional poverty measurements that include unidimensional and multidimensional assessment, comparing the two types of assessments with the common base on census data. Secondly, I explained the methodologies of the innovative geospatial techniques and high-resolution satellite measurements. Then, by comparing the census-based measures and innovative measures without the sufficiency of census, I concluded the similarities and differences between the two methodologies. Above all, within the entire process to build the comparison, reflections on the gaps in the research emerged to offer suggestions to further implications on the human development topic of poverty assessment and analysis.
