## Question #1.  What is development?

Development is a process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy. Freedom is essential to the process of development because of two reasons: first, the assessment of human progress is primarily in terms of the amount of freedoms that people have; second, the achievement of development is thoroughly dependent on people’s capability to achieve freedom on their own. 



## Question #2.  Is this an expansive or narrower view of development? 

The narrower views of development would be the simple consideration on the growth of GNP, industrialization, technological advance, or individual income. However, human freedom also depends on other determinants such as social/economic arrangements, political and civil rights, etc. The removal of the restrictions on people’s freedom to participate in the social, political, and economic life of the community is essential to development. Therefore, viewing development in terms of expanding substantive freedom that requires the removal of major sources of unfreedom like poverty, tyranny, poor economic opportunities is an expansive perspective. 



## Question #3. What are some of the sources of unfreedoms development requires being removed?

The sources of unfreedoms required to be removed include poverty, tyranny, poor economic opportunities, systematic social deprivation, neglect of public facilities including health care and education, intolerance or overactivity of repressive states like the rights of free speech. 
Take the lack of substantive freedoms to economic poverty as an example: people’s rights and freedom to satisfy hunger, to achieve sufficient nutrition, or to obtain remedies for normal illnesses, or the opportunity to be clothed and sheltered, or to enjoy clean water or sanitary facilities are restricted. 



## Question #4.  Why is free and sustainable agency a major engine of development?

Not only is free agency itself is an essential and constitutive part of development, it also contributes to the strengthening of free agencies of other kinds since the empirical interconnections exist among all the factors. What people can positively achieve is hugely influenced by sources of freedoms including economic opportunities, political liberties, social powers, the access to health and education. On the other side, the institutional arrangements for these opportunities towards freedom are influenced by people’s participation in social choices and public decisions, which are dependent on the free agency of people. Therefore, the effectiveness about the achievement of development is enhanced by the mutual connections. 



## Question #5.  What does Amartya Sen say about being generically against markets?

Freedom of exchange and transaction is the basic liberties that people have reason to value: this is the part of the way human beings in society live and interact with each other. 



## Question #6. What was the story of Kader Mia? What was the penalty of his economic unfreedom?

Kader Mia was a Muslim daily laborer who had come for work in the author’s neighboring house only for small amount of income. 


## Question #7.  Who were Condorcet and Malthus? What were their primary arguments regarding development and fertility?
