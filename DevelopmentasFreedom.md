## Question #1.  What is development?
 
Development is a process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy. Freedom is essential to the process of development because of two reasons: first, the assessment of human progress is primarily in terms of the amount of freedoms that people have; second, the achievement of development is thoroughly dependent on people’s capability to achieve freedom on their own. 
 
 
 
## Question #2.  Is this an expansive or narrower view of development? 
 
The narrower views of development would be the simple consideration on the growth of GNP, industrialization, technological advance, or individual income. However, human freedom also depends on other determinants such as social/economic arrangements, political and civil rights, etc. The removal of the restrictions on people’s freedom to participate in the social, political, and economic life of the community is essential to development. Therefore, viewing development in terms of expanding substantive freedom that requires the removal of major sources of unfreedom like poverty, tyranny, poor economic opportunities is an expansive perspective. 
 
 
 
## Question #3. What are some of the sources of unfreedoms development that require being removed?
 
The sources of unfreedoms required to be removed include poverty, tyranny, poor economic opportunities, systematic social deprivation, neglect of public facilities including health care and education, intolerance or overactivity of repressive states like the rights of free speech. 
Take the lack of substantive freedoms to economic poverty as an example: people’s rights and freedom to satisfy hunger, to achieve sufficient nutrition, or to obtain remedies for normal illnesses, or the opportunity to be clothed and sheltered, or to enjoy clean water or sanitary facilities are restricted. 
 
 
 
## Question #4.  Why is free and sustainable agency a major engine of development?
 
Not only is free agency itself an essential and constitutive part of development, it also contributes to the strengthening of free agencies of other kinds since the empirical interconnections exist among all the factors. What people can positively achieve is hugely influenced by sources of freedoms including economic opportunities, political liberties, social powers, the access to health and education. On the other side, the institutional arrangements for these opportunities towards freedom are influenced by people’s participation in social choices and public decisions, which are dependent on the free agency of people. Therefore, the effectiveness of development is enhanced by the mutual connections. 
 
 
 
## Question #5.  What does Amartya Sen say about being genetically against markets?
 
Freedom of exchange and transaction is the basic liberties that people have reason to value: this is the part of the way human beings in society live and interact with each other. To be generically against markets would be almost as odd as being generically against conversations between people. The contribution of the market mechanism to economic growth is important but comes only after the direct significance of the freedom to interchange has been acknowledged. 
 
The crucial challenges of development in many developing countries include the need for the freeing of labor from explicit or implicit bondage that denies access to the open labor market. The denial of access to product markets is often among the deprivations from which many small cultivators and struggling producers suffer under traditional arrangements and restrictions. The freedom to participate in economic interchange has a basic role in social living. It is important to not only give the markets their due, but also appreciate the role of other economic, social, and political freedoms to enhance the quality of people’s lives. 
 
 
 
## Question #6. What was the story of Kader Mia? What was the penalty of his economic unfreedom?
 
Kader Mia was a Muslim daily laborer who had come for work in the author’s neighboring house only for small amount of income. He had been knifed on the street by some communal thugs. His wife had told him not to go into a hostile area like this in such troubled times but he had to go out in search of work and only a bit of earning because his family had nothing to eat. The penalty of his economic unfreedom turned out to be death. Economic unfreedom, in the form of extreme poverty, can make a person a helpless prey in a violation of other kinds of freedom like social or political freedom. 
 
 
 
## Question #7.  Who were Condorcet and Malthus? What were their primary arguments regarding development and fertility?
 
Condorcet was a great eighteenth-century French rationalist who expected that fertility rates would come down with “the progress of reason” so that greater security, more education, and more freedom of reflected decisions would restrain population growth. 
Thomas Robert Malthus was Condorcet’s contemporary who opposed his opinion. Malthus argued that beside the inadequacy of necessaries of life, nothing else should indispose this greater number of people to marry early or prevent them from rearing in health the largest families: the restraint in population growth would not exist. 
 
 
 
## Question #8.  Who was Maitreyee? What did she wonder about? What was her question, and why was it relevant?  What was the perspective Aristotle provided regarding immortality and wealth?
 
At a conversation on the subject of the possibility of earning more money around the eighth century B.C. of some special interest, Maitreyee and her husband Yajnavalkya proceed rapidly to a bigger issue than simply the ways and means of becoming wealthier: How far would wealth go to help them get what they want. Maitreyee wondered whether it could be the case that whether she could achieve immortality when the situation “the whole earth, full of wealth” were to belong just to her alone. While her husband responded that there is no hope of immortality by wealth, Maitreyee asked the question that “what should I do with that by which I do not become immortal?” This became an important citation in Indian religious philosophy to illustrate both the nature of the human predicament and the limitations of the material world. 
 
Aristotle believed that “wealth is not the good we are seeking, but is merely useful and for the sake of something else.” Wealth is viewed as the admirable general-purpose means for obtaining more freedom to lead the kind of lives we have reason to value instead of something desirable for its own sake. Wealth means the fundamental need for development: it brings out opportunity and resources to realize the creative ideas we aimed to build. 
 
 

## Question #9.  What is the usefulness of wealth? What are some forms of unfreedoms?  Does any form of government appear to reduce the probability of famine? Why?
 
The usefulness of wealth helps us to achieve the substantive freedoms. Wealth plays an essential role in determining living conditions and the quality of life. An adequate conception of development must go much beyond the accumulation of wealth and the growth of gross national product and other income-related variables. Forms of unfreedom include undernutrition caused by poverty and famine, little access to health care, sanitary arrangements, clean water, functional education, gainful employment, or economic and social security. 
 
Plenty of evidence suggests that economic growth is more a matter of a friendlier economic climate than of a harsher political system. Democratic governments which tend to face public criticism have strong incentives to undertake famines and other catastrophes compared with authoritarian rulers who are actually rarely affected by famines. Political and civil freedom that democratic governments bring to the public are constitutive elements of human freedom, leading to the effective reaction towards famine. Having the intention to win elections and face public criticism, democratic governments have strong incentives to undertake measures to avert famines. However, authoritarian rulers who are rarely affected by famines or other such economic calamities themselves, tend to lack the incentive to have timely preventive measures. 
 
 

## Question #10.  How do American blacks survival rates compare to American whites, China and Kerala State in India?  
What about in the case of men? women? men in urban areas? 
How do African-Americans incomes compare to China, Kerala and Bangladesh?
 
American whites have higher survival rates compared to American blacks, and the rates difference become larger and larger when the age grows up. In the United States, although African Americans tend to do better in terms of survival at low age groups, they have a lower chance of reaching advanced ages than do people in the immensely poorer economies of China or the Indian state of Kerala. In fact, men in China and Kerala decisively outlive African American men in terms of surviving to older age groups. African American women end up having a survival pattern for the higher ages similar to that of the much poorer Chinese, and decidedly lower survival rates than the even poorer Indians in Kerala. For both women and men, American blacks are more deprived than the low-income Indians in Kerala; in the case of men, they are more deprived than the Chinese. 
 
Condition of living to ripe old ages of African-American is worse in urban areas. The black male populations in particular U.S. cities are overtaken in terms of survival by people from China or Kerala, as well as many other third world populations like Bangladesh at much earlier age. In fact, Bangladeshi men have a better chance of living to ages beyond forty years than African American men from Harlem district of New York. 
 
American blacks suffer from relative deprivation in terms of income per head compared to American whites, but they are very many times richer in income terms than the people of China, Kerala, or Bangladesh. The inverse relationship between the income status differences of African-Americans and China, Kerala, and Bangladesh, and the survival rates is noticeable. 
 
 

## Question #11.  What is the significance of the American Civil War in the context of the process of modern development?
 
The American Civil War allowed the slaves to be freed so that many planters reconstruct their woks on the basis of wage payments. Civil war changes the situation of workers to make them free in a way not found in earlier modes of production, and builds the freedom of employment and labor market under capitalism. The extension of the freedom of workers in a society to sell their labor power is an enhancement of their positive freedom, which is an important measure of the wellness of the society. 
 
 

## Question #12.  Sen describes a "fierce" and "friendly" approach to development.  What are these? Which approach does he favor?
 
A “fierce” approach is an attitude to view the process of development as a “fierce” process with much “blood, sweat, and tears”, seeing the world in which wisdom demands toughness. It demands calculated neglect of various concerns that are considered to be “soft-headed including financial softness, political relaxation, plentiful social expenditure, or complaisant poverty relief:” what is needed inside this austere attitudinal mode is “toughness and discipline.” An alternative approach is to see development as essentially a “friendly” process exemplified by the combination of supportive activities, beneficial exchanges, the working of social safety nets, political liberties, or social development. It views development as a process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy. Sen favors the “friendly” approach more than the “fierce” approach. 
 
 

## Question #13.  What constitutes development analysis according to Sen?
 
The primary end and the principal means of development can be called respectively the “constitutive role” and the “instrumental role” of freedom in development. The constitutive role of freedom relates to the importance of substantive freedom in enriching human life including elementary capabilities and freedoms associated with education, political participations, and free speeches. 
 
 

## Question #14.  How did Sen compare China and India? What were some of the strengths and weaknesses of each country?
 
The governments of both China and India have been making efforts to move toward a more open, internationally active, market-oriented economy. While Indian efforts have slowly met with some success, the kind of huge success that China has built has failed to occur in India. 
 
From the standpoint of social preparedness, China is way ahead of India in being able to make use of the market economy. Although pre-reform China was skeptical of markets, it indeed believed in basic education and widely shared health care. Highly literate people especially the young with good schooling facilities played an important role in seizing the economic opportunities offered by a supportive market system when China turned to marketization in 1979. However, a half-illiterate adult population in 1991 when it turned to marketization couldn’t allow the country to move forward fast enough in market economy, not to mention that the literacy and education situation is not much improved today. 
 
Due to the social commitment of pre-reform China to both health care and education, the health conditions in China were also much better than in India. The social backwardness of India with the concentration on higher education and massive negligence of school education, and its substantial neglect of basic health left the country unprepared for a widely shared economic expansion. By contrast, the social commitment of China created social opportunities to bring into dynamic use after moving into marketization. 
 
The real handicaps that China experiences compared with India are due to the lack of democratic freedoms. When it comes to flexibility of economic policy and the responsiveness of social crisis and unpredictable disasters like famine, the protective power of democracy showed up. 
 
 

## Question #15.  How does GNP per capita positively correlate with life expectancy?
 
Presenting the GNP per head and life expectancy at birth of China, Sri Lanka, Namibia, Brazil, South Africa, Gabon, and Kerala, the relationship is shown: despite the very low levels of income, the people of Kerala, China, or Sri Lanka have enormously higher levels of life expectancy than do much richer populations of Brazil, South Africa, Namibia, and Gabon. 
 
Since life expectancy variations relate to a variety of social opportunities like health care, educational facilities, and epidemiological policies that are essential to development, an income-centered view is insufficient and defective to have a full understanding of the process of development. 
 
 

## Question #16.  Compare growth mediated and support led processes? Provide some successful examples.
 
The support-led process does not operate through fast economic growth but through a program of skillful social support of health care, education, and other social arrangements. It is based on the fact that the relevant social services are labor intensive so as to be relatively inexpensive in poor and low-wage economies. Although the poor economy may have less money to spend on health care and education, it also needs less money on providing the same services compared with richer countries. 
 
The experiences of economies such as Sri Lanka, pre-reform China, Costa Rica or Kerala, which have had incredibly rapid reductions in mortality rates and enhancement of living conditions while with not so much economic growth are great examples of the support-led process. I remember in Hans Rosling’s presentation, China indeed first moved upwards on child survival rates through the improvement of health care and education, and then started the enhancement of the economy. 
 
The growth-mediated process works through fast economic growth and is dependent on the growth process to be wide-based and economically broad, having strong employment orientation, and on the utilization of the enhanced economic prosperity to expand social services like health care, education, and social insecurity. 
 
 

## Question #17. How were these examples successful at advancing healthcare and education?
 
A country need not wait until it is much richer before embarking on rapid expansion of basic education and health care inside the support-led process. Despite low incomes, through an adequate program of social services with strong social commitment, the quality of life, literacy, and education can be enormously raised. Within the solid social preparedness, the country could then move from there to broader achievements including economic growth and the standard features of quality of life. 
 
 

## Question #18.  How did England exemplify growth mediated development in terms of life expectancy?
 
At the turn of the last century, Britain still had a life expectancy at birth that was lower than the average life expectancy for low-income countries today. However, longevity in Britain did rise rapidly over the century. Although within social attitudes and public arrangements, life expectancy increased sharply during the war decades. However, other than the war periods, with fast economic growth shown by GDP per head, growth-mediated development is shown inside the long-term progress. Although the expansion of life expectancy is slow, it is consistent all the time dependent on economic broadness and strong employment orientation. Using the improved economic prosperity, the British government could expand social services like health care gradually, leading to a greater life expectancy growth.
